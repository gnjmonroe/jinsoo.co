      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        I'm a freelance front-end developer based in Seoul. Sometimes I design 
        the projects I develop.

      <p class="about-text">
        I started out by making exhibition and portfolio websites for 
        architects, usually applying motifs and aesthetics from architecture 
        and urban design to navigational design (e.g., subway maps and korean 
        advertisement stickers). These days I focus more on building and 
        maintaing information systems and digital tools. I still do 
        design/develop projects occasionally.

        at a local architecture firm. Before that, I worked as a product 
        engineer in the auto industry, shepherding the 2018 Ford Edge center 
        console, in its 118+ permutations, to production. I have degrees in
