      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        I am a freelance front-end developer based in Seoul. Sometimes I design 
        the projects I develop.

      <p class="about-text">
        I started out by making exhibition and portfolio websites for 
        architects, applying motifs and aesthetics from architecture 
        and urban design to navigation and interaction design for the web

        console, in its 118+ permutations, to production. I have degrees in
