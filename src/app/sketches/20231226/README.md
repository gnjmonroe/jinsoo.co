Abstracted reflection and distortion from glass bricks.

## Notes
what draws my eye
- I know from experience that there is more than a light blue fill on the other side of that window. As a person, I know that glass bricks are only used 0~2m from the ground. There should be more than 3 solid colors in the reflection, but there aren't. and that interests me.

what essence I'm focusing on
- The glass brick as a visual black box. Think of the glass brick as a component that performs a series of visual transformations on a background.
